# Claude Code Sessions - Vim Configuration

This file tracks collaborative work sessions with Claude Code for improving and extending vim configuration.

## Session 2025-08-23: Text Dimmer Enhancement

### Problem
The text-dimmer.vim plugin had a distracting issue where LSP/CoC word highlighting would still appear in dimmed areas, breaking the focus effect. When focusing on specific code sections, word occurrences throughout the dimmed text would be highlighted, making it hard to concentrate.

### Solution Implemented
Enhanced the text-dimmer plugin with comprehensive word highlighting suppression:

**Key Features Added:**
- `DisableCocHighlighting()` - Disables all word highlighting during dimming
- `EnableCocHighlighting()` - Restores highlighting when dimming is cleared
- `IdentifyHighlightGroups()` - Debug function to identify highlight groups (mapped to `<leader>d`)

**Technical Approach:**
1. **Event Suppression**: Uses `eventignore` to disable cursor events that trigger highlighting
2. **Match Clearing**: Clears existing highlight matches before applying dimming
3. **Group Linking**: Links all word highlighting groups to `DimmedText` color
4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: Handles CoC, LSP, TreeSitter, vim-illuminate, search highlights

**Files Modified:**
- `text-dimmer.vim` - Added ~100 lines of highlighting suppression logic

**Usage:**
- `<leader>h` (visual) - Toggle dimming 
- `<leader>H` (visual) - Focus mode
- `<leader>h/H` (normal) - Clear dimming
- `<leader>d` (normal) - Debug highlight groups

### Outcome
✅ **Success!** The focus mode now provides a truly distraction-free experience with no word highlighting in dimmed areas.

## Session 2025-08-24: Text Dimmer Word Highlighting Bug Fix

### Problem
The text-dimmer feature had a bug where word highlighting (like "delete"/"DELETE") was being dimmed even in the focused (non-dimmed) area. The global highlight group linking in `DisableCocHighlighting()` was affecting the entire buffer instead of just the dimmed regions.

### Root Cause
The `DisableCocHighlighting()` function was globally linking all word highlighting groups (`CocHighlightText`, `LspReferenceText`, etc.) to `DimmedText`, which affected both dimmed and focused areas.

### Solution Implemented
**Simplified Approach:**
- Removed global highlight group linking that caused the bug
- Now only clears existing matches and disables highlighting autocommands
- Allows normal word highlighting in focused areas while preventing new highlights in dimmed areas

**Files Modified:**
- `text-dimmer.vim` - Simplified `DisableCocHighlighting()` and `EnableCocHighlighting()` functions

### Outcome
✅ **Success!** Word highlighting now works correctly in focused areas while maintaining distraction-free dimmed regions.
